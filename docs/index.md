# K-12 Open Content Exchange

K-12 OCX is a specification for publishing OER (Open Educational Resources) on the web and packaging
that OER for exchange with other parties.

This specification is comprised of the following features:

1. A [Manifest](/manifest) with metadata for aggregated resources, i.e. hierarchical mapping of resources and their relationships. This is done via an enriched extension of sitemaps.

2. [Metadata semantic markup](/metadata/markup) for OER, using mostly OER schema whenever possible, but still allowing user specific definitions

3. Base implementation (or tool) for [packaging and exporting](/packaging) OCX metadata with the OER resources, using Common Cartridge.

4. An additional set of [styling guides](/styling) for allowing resources to keep visual integrity, or to change themes accordingly to different consumers.
