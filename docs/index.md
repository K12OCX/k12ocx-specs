# K-12 Open Content Exchange

K-12 OCX is a specification for publishing OER (Open Educational Resources) on the web and packaging
that OER for exchange with other parties.

This specification is comprised of 3 main features:

1. A metadata manifest for aggregated resources, i.e. hierarchical mapping of resources and their relationships. This is done via an enriched extension of sitemaps.

2. Semantic markup for OER, using mostly OER schema whenever possible, but still allowing user specific definitions

3. Base implementation (or tool) for packaging and exporting OCX metadata with the OER resources, using CommonCartridge.
