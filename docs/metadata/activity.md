An Activity is a part of a Lesson. It may contain content for students, teachers, or both.

Order (within a Lesson) is important, so the structure should maintain the intended order.

Examples:

- [A Tale of Two Triangles (Part 1)](https://im.openupresources.org/6/teachers/1/7.html#activity-2) (IM)
- [Fluency Practice](https://www.unbounded.org/downloads/4502/preview?slug_id=37486) (UnboundEd)
