The Entities represented The curriculum, content and materials being exchanged are represented in the K12 OCX Content Model using the using the OER Schema model: Course , Module , Unit , Lesson , Activity , Assessment and SupportingMaterial are all sub classes of oer:LearningComponent . SupportingMaterial , SupplementalMaterial and ReferencedMaterial are sub classes of ocx:AssociatedMaterial (to do: define this formally) LearningComponents are related to other LearningComponents using the hasPart property (and the reverse isPartOf ). LearningComponents are related to AssociatedMaterial using the ocx:material property (an extension of oer:material ) Note : This model is based on schema.org , and hence on RDF and uses the W3C architecture of the World Wide Web .

Identifiers As we use an RDF-based model to describe the CCM being exchanged, any content that is to be described must be identifiable with a URI, preferably a resolvable http:// URI. Since a Course/Module/Unit/etc is not a web page, the URI that is used to identify such content must be distinct from that used for the web page through which it is represented. Note : A useful pattern adopted in this documentation is the use of fragment identifiers based on the web page URL to identify entities represented on that page. So, if the web page http://example.org/MyLesson represents an OER Schema Lesson, the URI used to identify that lesson might be of the form http://example.org/MyLesson#lesson or similar. Content Files and Formats The content being transferred may be contained in a single digital document or many. As this content will be presented through web pages or ebooks, the format of the digital document must be HTML5 or translatable to HTML5.

These digital documents may contain content from any level of the OER Schema model from Course down to Activity, and all smaller levels comprised by it. For example a digital document might contain a Lesson with associated Activities, Supporting Materials and Assessments. Each of these may also be structured into parts. The Open Textbook Network have published a useful vocabulary for describing these parts that applies at any OER Schema level, which is divided into openers, closers and \"integrated pedagogic devices,\" for each of which they provide several specific examples. Information to be provided The in-page markup is required to: define and identify with a URI the main pedagogical content, i.e. the CCM resources, from any other content that may be in the same document or web page (for example if the resource is in a repository or on a website there may be information and navigation elements relating to the service or site as a whole). define and identify with a URI the divisions of the document that are pedagogically significant in terms of their nature and their educational intent, for example distinguishing an introduction that provides context from the activities designed to foster understanding and from an end of lesson assessment. When a resource is being reused, repurposed or remixed these are the divisions that may be treated as somewhat independent resources. describe educationally significant properties and relationships of the resource as a whole and the significant divisions. These may include: what is being taught, with alignments to standards where appropriate and the educational level for which the content is suitable; the educational nature and intent of the resource; the educational level for which the resource is appropriate; specifying directly or indirectly who each part of the resource is intended for, e.g. distinguish teachers' notes from material that is presented to students. specifying relationships with other content, e.g. homework, classroom materials, teacher's guide etc. specify the ordering of the parts of the document. This is necessary because technology used to transmit, store and reuse the content may disaggregate the logical parts of the document in a way that does not preserve the implicit ordering in the document. Outline of the general approach The digital document which contains the CCM is divided into parts using the HTML5 semantic sectioning elements <main> <chapter> <article> <section> <aside> <header> <footer> <nav> . Descriptive information is provided using RDFa for the document as a whole and for each section individually. schema.org and oerschema object types, supplemented where necessary with custom ocx type are used to provide information about the nature of the document and its sections. Often the schema.org type will be vague or generic and so it can be supplemented with a more specific oerschema or ocx resource type. In such cases the schema.org/learningResourceType property should be used to provide similar information about the resource type in a form that is intelligible to systems that understand only schema.org. schema.org properties may be used to provide information about other aspects of the document and its sections. Where no suitable schema.org property exists, OER Schema properties will be used, and if no suitable OER Schema property exists either a custom OCX term will be used. Where appropriate, values for properties will come from (in order of preference): LRMI, OER Schema, or custom OCX vocabularies based on existing practice. Where the top level resource (e.g. a Lesson) comprises several parts (e.g. Activities) the schema.org/hasPart property will be used to provide the structural relationship between the top level resource and the parts. Where this is the case information about the top level resource will be held to relevant to all the parts unless more specific information is provided for the part.

A single file may contain pedagogically significant content that is subdivided into parts, such as a Lesson with associated Activities, Supporting Materials and Assessments. The file may also contain content that is not pedagogically significant, such as banner and navigation content that relates to the site hosting the content. HTML5 sectioning elements must be used with JSON-LD or RDFa metadata to define and identify with a URI the main pedagogical content and the significant subdivisions. For normative definitions of the HTML5 elements discussed here see HTML5.2 Sections . <body> must be used at the top-level for the content of the HTML document. It may contain information that is not part of the CCM, for example it may contain navigation relating to the collection/website of which this resource is a part or information about the provider of the resource. One of <main> , <article> , <chapter> must be used to container the CCM resource. There are clear-cut cases where <article> and <chapter> are appropriate; <main> is general enough as a catch-all ensuring that there is an appropriate top-level element for any individual CCM resource. Multiple <section> may be used for subdivisions of the CCM resource. Sections may have sections. Subdivisions that might be considered a resource worth reusing or repurposing for use in their own right should be contained within a <section> . For example, where a document describes a lesson that comprises several activities that may be useful in other lessons, each activity should be separate <section> . <aside> represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content of the parenting sectioning content. <header> and <footer> are useful within any of the above elements as containers for information that relates to all the parts of that container. They are not considered to be significant resources in their own right. <nav> (typically in <header> or <footer> or acting as an implicit header or footer) contains navigation links at some level. <div> may be used as a container of convenience for grouping together content within a <section> for the purpose of describing it with RDFa/microdata. Example Some OCX content is on a webpage, it comprises introductory material and a learning activity. <html> <head><title>Example</title></head> <body> <header> <nav><-- links to other pages --></nav> </header> <main><-- container for the OCX content --> <header><-- note that any section may have a header --> <h1>OCX Example</h1> <p>Some general information about the resource</p> </header> <section> <h2>Introduction to example subject</h2> <div>content for introduction</div> </section> <section> <h2>My example activity</h2> <div>content for the learning activity</div> </section> </main> </body> </html> Identifying the subdivisions and their types Each significant subdivision must be identifiable and describable as a resource separately from the whole document. A suitable HTTP URI identifier should be provided. Absent any web based service that will resolve a URI to deliver a representation of the resource, a reasonable default is to use a fragment identifier such as #section001. Such fragment identifiers should begin with a letter [a-z|A-Z]. OCX will thus conform to the W3C Architecture of the World Wide Web in its use of identifiers. In order to aid the extraction of significant subdivisions that are thus identified, the HTML5 id attribute of the sectioning element that contains that subdivision should be used with a value equal to the fragment identifier. Such id values must begin with a letter. The nature of the CCM or significant subdivision should be denoted with types drawn from, in order of preference, schema.org, OER Schema, and custom OCX types. Where OER Schema or OCX types are used, a broader matching schema.org type should also be used in order to provide information to systems and tools that understand schema.org but not OCX. Metadata about a subdivision should be placed within the HTML sectioning element that contains that subdivision. This ensures that if this section is extracted from the document the metadata travels with it. Relevant schema.org types Useful schema.org types can be found under schema.org/CreativeWork which provides normative definitions, and include: Book, Course, AudioBook, WebSite DigitalDocument, Chapter, WebPage Article & subtypes: NewsArticle Report ScholarlyArticle TechArticle Quotation HowTo, HowToStep, HowToSection, HowToDirection, HowToTip SoftwareApplication VisualArtwork, Painting, Photograph, Atlas, Map Movie Question, Answer (used for marking FAQs) MediaObject & subtypes AudioObject, DataDownload, ImageObject, MusicVideoObject, VideoObject schema.org must be used as the main vocabulary for the document. schema.org types may be identified with cURIs with no namespace, e.g. CreativeWork . Relevant OER Schema types Course Module Unit Lesson Task Activity Project Practice Assessment Quiz Submission SupportingMaterial CourseSyllabus As defined by OER Schema . OER Schema types should be identified with cURIs using the RDF namespace prefix oer: for the http://oerschema.org/ namespace URI, for example oer:Lesson. Custom OCX types OCX types may be added as this specification matures. OCX types should be identified with cURIs using the RDF namespace prefix ocx: for the ocx namespace URI and , e.g. ocx:NewType. In-page relationships and inheritance The schema.org/hasPart relationship may be used to indicate that a section is a part of the parent resource. For example that a Lesson has parts which are SupportingMaterial and an Activity. Where there are hasPart relationships, many descriptive properties of the parent resource may be assumed to be inherited by the child unless another value is provided for that property in the descriptive metadata of the child. These inheritable properties are identified in this specification under the of the descriptive properties for each oerschema type. oerschema provides other types of relationship that are also described in this specification under the descriptive properties for each oerschema type. Example The example above is identified as a lesson plan, the introductory material and activity are identified as significant subdivisions. 1. with RDFa metadata <html> <head><title>Example</title></head> <body vocab=\"http://schema.org/\" prefix=\"ocx: https://github.com/K12OCX/k12ocx-specs/terms/ oer: http://oerschema.org/\"> <header> <nav><-- links to other pages --></nav> </header> <main id=\"LessonPlan\" resource=\"#LessonPlan\" typeof=\"CreativeWork oer:Lesson\"> <header> <h1>OCX Example</h1> <p>Some general information about the resource</p> </header> <section id=\"intro\" property=\"haspart\" resource=\"#intro\" typeof=\"CreativeWork oer:SupportingMaterial\"> <h2>Introduction to example subject</h2> <div>content for introduction</div> </section> <section id=\"activity\" property=\"haspart\" resource=\"#activity\" typeof=\"CreativeWork oer:Activity\"> <h2>My example activity</h2> <div>content for the learning activity</div> </section> </main> </body> </html> 2. with JSON-LD metadata <html> <head><title>Example</title></head> <body> <header> <nav><-- links to other pages --></nav> </header> <main id=\"LessonPlan\"> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": [ \"http://schema.org\", {\"oer\": \"http://oerschema.org/\"} ], \"@id\": \"#LessonPlan\", \"@type\": [\"CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"], \"hasPart\": [ {\"@id\": \"#Activity\"}, {\"@id\": \"#Intro\"} ] } </script> <header> <h1>OCX Example</h1> <p>Some general information about the resource</p> </header> <section id=\"Intro\"> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": [ \"http://schema.org\", {\"oer\": \"http://oerschema.org/\"} ], \"@id\": \"#Intro\", \"@type\": [\"CreativeWork\",\"oer:SupportingMaterial\"] } </script> <h2>Introduction to example subject</h2> <div>content for introduction</div> </section> <section id=\"Activity\"> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": [ \"http://schema.org\", {\"oer\": \"http://oerschema.org/\"} ], \"@id\": \"#Activity\", \"@type\": [\"CreativeWork\",\"oer:Activity\"] } </script> <h2>My example activity</h2> <div>content for the learning activity</div> </section> </main> </body> </html>","title":"In-page structuring"},{"location":"inpage/structure/#html5-elements-for-the-divisions","text":"CCM documents should be in HTML5, or may be in an equivalent format that can be mapped to HTML5.

They are not considered to be significant resources in their own right. <nav> (typically in <header> or <footer> or acting as an implicit header or footer) contains navigation links at some level. <div> may be used as a container of convenience for grouping together content within a <section> for the purpose of describing it with RDFa/microdata.","title":"HTML5 Elements for the divisions"},{"location":"inpage/structure/#example","text":"Some OCX content is on a webpage, it comprises introductory material and a learning activity. <html> <head><title>Example</title></head> <body> <header> <nav><-- links to other pages --></nav> </header> <main><-- container for the OCX content --> <header><-- note that any section may have a header --> <h1>OCX Example</h1> <p>Some general information about the resource</p> </header> <section> <h2>Introduction to example subject</h2> <div>content for introduction</div> </section> <section> <h2>My example activity</h2> <div>content for the learning activity</div> </section> </main> </body> </html>","title":"Example"},{"location":"inpage/structure/#identifying-the-subdivisions-and-their-types","text":"Each significant subdivision must be identifiable and describable as a resource separately from the whole document. A suitable HTTP URI identifier should be provided. Absent any web based service that will resolve a URI to deliver a representation of the resource, a reasonable default is to use a fragment identifier such as #section001. Such fragment identifiers should begin with a letter [a-z|A-Z]. OCX will thus conform to the W3C Architecture of the World Wide Web in its use of identifiers. In order to aid the extraction of significant subdivisions that are thus identified, the HTML5 id attribute of the sectioning element that contains that subdivision should be used with a value equal to the fragment identifier. Such id values must begin with a letter. The nature of the CCM or significant subdivision should be denoted with types drawn from, in order of preference, schema.org, OER Schema, and custom OCX types. Where OER Schema or OCX types are used, a broader matching schema.org type should also be used in order to provide information to systems and tools that understand schema.org but not OCX.

Accepted values are existing OER schema or schema.org types or well-defined, publicly available, not-yet-accepted sub-types of schema.org types. ocx:format Text optional The expected format of content metadata. Purpose of this tag is to allow [crawlers] to further filter sitemap URLs and crawl only pages that have relevant metadata and have it in a format [crawler] is capable of processing. Accepted values: JSON-LD , Microdata and RDFa ocx:loc URL optional Provide the URL where metadata is located. Unless metadata is placed on a web page different from content page, this tag can be skipped. ocx:xpath Text optional Provide where exactly the metadata is located inside document. The value should be a HTML XPath ocx:name Text optional Resource name or title ocx:teaser Text optional Small text describing the resource content or objective ocx:parent Text | URL optional identifier or URL ( loc ) for the parent resource. ocx:image URL optional An image or thumbnail for the resource. This extended sitemap namespace might be included in a site's main /sitemap.xml file or it might be included in a dedicated sitemap-structured file (index) with a different name such as /ocx.xml . Each sitemap file that you provide must have no more than 50,000 URL elements. Keep in mind that if you are adding optional tags, you may hit the 50MB uncompressed limit before you hit the 50,000 entries limit. If you want to list more than 50,000 URLs, you must create multiple Sitemap files then list each of them in a Sitemap index file (sitemaps does not support nesting of index files). Make sure that your robots.txt file isn't blocking any of the items included in each sitemap entry Prefer using full URLs, i.e. locations for content or landing-pages that require 'hash marks' or fragment identifier are discouraged Sitemap Basics The documentation at Sitemap.org is straightforard and worth reading for any web developer or publisher; here we will give a minimal definition of the protocol and highlight the elements most relevant for publishing curriculum. A sitemap at its most simple is an XML file that is available at the root URL of a website (e.g. https://www.google.com/sitemap.xml), which tells automated web crawlers what web pages are accessible on the site. Like OCX, the sitemap format is a recommended convention rather than a global specification; however, it has become a de facto standard thanks to adoption among the top search engine (e.g. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!). The bare minimum sitemap file would contain nothing more than a list of site URLs, marked up with the appropriate XML tags, e.g.: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\"> <url> <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc> </url> <url> <loc>http://www.example.org/about-example.html</loc> </url> </urlset> </xml> As you can see, each URL in the sitemap has a <loc> tag which describes its location on the web. There are three additional (optional) tags which can describe each URL in the sitemap, and those will be covered below. Sitemap Conventions for Open Curriculum While web-crawling \"robots\" will crawl all public URLs on your site whether or not they are specified in the sitemap (indeed, whether or not the site has a sitemap), you cannot assume the same from the robotic consumers of your curriculum via the OCX manifest. In most cases, those consumers are only interested in the curriculum content and will not attempt to crawl your site for any other reasons. Therefore, it's critical that the OCX manifest include all of the URLs relevant to the curriculum , whether those URLs are included in the main sitemap.xml file on your site or in a sitemap dedicated to the curriculum section of your site. In addition to the <loc> tag, the sitemap protocol supports three additional (optional) tags to describe a given URL: <lastmod> , <changefreq> , and <priority> . All of these elements are important for helping consumers stay up to date with changes to the curriculum. <lastmod> - The lastmod tag identifies when the content at the URL was last updated. The <lastmod> value for each URL should reflect changes to the curriculum's content at that URL, rather than the HTML page at that URL; this means it should only be included if you are able to reliably track those changes. <changefreq> - The changefreq tag identifies an estimated frequency for changes to the content. In most cases, K-12 curriculum materials are only significantly changed once per year, aside from corrections and minor wording changes, and consumers of that curriculum will typically be familiar with that same cycle. In those case, the <changefreq> tag will be unnecessary and/or difficult to estimate for most curriculum component URLS; however, any page which tracks the ongoing minor changes to that curriculum should be included in the OCX manifest and described with a sensible <changefreq> value which reflects a realistic frequency of those changes.

Keep in mind that if you are adding optional tags, you may hit the 50MB uncompressed limit before you hit the 50,000 entries limit.

A sitemap at its most simple is an XML file that is available at the root URL of a website (e.g. https://www.google.com/sitemap.xml), which tells automated web crawlers what web pages are accessible on the site. Like OCX, the sitemap format is a recommended convention rather than a global specification; however, it has become a de facto standard thanks to adoption among the top search engine (e.g. Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!). The bare minimum sitemap file would contain nothing more than a list of site URLs, marked up with the appropriate XML tags, e.g.: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\"> <url> <loc>http://www.example.com/</loc> </url> <url> <loc>http://www.example.org/about-example.html</loc> </url> </urlset> </xml> As you can see, each URL in the sitemap has a <loc> tag which describes its location on the web. There are three additional (optional) tags which can describe each URL in the sitemap, and those will be covered below.","title":"Sitemap Basics"},{"location":"manifest/locate/#sitemap-conventions-for-open-curriculum","text":"While web-crawling \"robots\" will crawl all public URLs on your site whether or not they are specified in the sitemap (indeed, whether or not the site has a sitemap), you cannot assume the same from the robotic consumers of your curriculum via the OCX manifest. In most cases, those consumers are only interested in the curriculum content and will not attempt to crawl your site for any other reasons. Therefore, it's critical that the OCX manifest include all of the URLs relevant to the curriculum , whether those URLs are included in the main sitemap.xml file on your site or in a sitemap dedicated to the curriculum section of your site. In addition to the <loc> tag, the sitemap protocol supports three additional (optional) tags to describe a given URL: <lastmod> , <changefreq> , and <priority> . All of these elements are important for helping consumers stay up to date with changes to the curriculum. <lastmod> - The lastmod tag identifies when the content at the URL was last updated. The <lastmod> value for each URL should reflect changes to the curriculum's content at that URL, rather than the HTML page at that URL; this means it should only be included if you are able to reliably track those changes. <changefreq> - The changefreq tag identifies an estimated frequency for changes to the content. In most cases, K-12 curriculum materials are only significantly changed once per year, aside from corrections and minor wording changes, and consumers of that curriculum will typically be familiar with that same cycle. In those case, the <changefreq> tag will be unnecessary and/or difficult to estimate for most curriculum component URLS; however, any page which tracks the ongoing minor changes to that curriculum should be included in the OCX manifest and described with a sensible <changefreq> value which reflects a realistic frequency of those changes. For example: <url> <loc>http://www.example.org/ela/grade-2/errata.html</loc> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> </url> <priority> - The priority tag defines a URL's importance compared to the rest of the site.

Editor's note : for more information about the thinking behind this approach see Structure and sequence of book- or course-like resources . An Unordered Aggregation We represent the whole-part relationships of complex curriculum materials using schema.org and OER Schema. Schema.org org allows us to say that a CreativeWork (such as a Book) has parts (Chapters). The terminology of Books and Chapters may be too restrictive for curriculum materials in general, and so we recommend the use of OER Schema's type vocabulary.

The leniency of domain and range specification in schema.org allows us to treat the OER Schema types as if they were CreativeWorks. Example A module comprises two topics, one of the topics comprises three lessons { \"@context\": { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" , \"sdo\": \"http://schema.org/\" , \"oer\": \"http://oerschema.org/\", \"sdo:hasPart\" : { \"@type\" : \"@id\" } }, \"@graph\": [ { \"@id\": \"ex:Module1#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Module\"], \"sdo:hasPart\": [\"ex:TopicA#A\", \"ex:TopicB#A\" ] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:TopicA#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Unit\"], \"sdo:hasPart\": [ \"ex:Lesson1#A\", \"ex:Lesson2#A\", \"ex:Lesson3#A\" ] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:TopicB#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Unit\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson1#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson2#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson3#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] } ] } Editor's Note: hacking the context for sdo:hasPart to be stricter than schema.org's own and to generate links not values. Editor's Note: do folk prefer their JSON-LD examples as separate linked objects, as above, or as nested objects? Notes: The identifiers should be different to the URLs of specific instances of these resources. They identify relationships that are true for any instance of these resources, and as such they identify an abstract resource of which specific instances are manifestations. Appending #A to the URL of the official or authoritative web page for the resource is a useful pattern for generating a different URI but still using a URI that will provide human users with a meaningful link. Further information about the resources could be provided here, such as the URL to locate the content ( sdo:url ) and the name ( sdo:name ) of the resource, however this would duplicate information in the sitemap used to locate the resources, and embedded markup used to describe the resources. An Ordered Aggregation Editor's Note OPEN ISSUE : there are two options for ordering the component resources in an aggregation. Option 1 is a JSON array (i.e. an ordered list) of identifiers specifying a default order. This mirrors the approach taken for W3C Web Publications (ePub for the web). Option 2 is inspired by OAI-ORE and leverages schema.org ItemLists. Option 2 is conceptually and practically far more complex, however it may be more robust, and may more useful for providing information about next & previous components within the files for each component. It remains an open issue as to whether the extra complexity is manageable or necessary. An Ordered Aggregation - Option 1 We provide information about the default logical and pedagogically appropriate sequence for displaying or presenting the components of complex curriculum materials using a JSON array of URIs, each URI representing a component. This approach is based on the default reading order of the (draft) W3C Web Publications spec. Recommended Vocabulary Identifiers Vocabulary Namespace : Context URI OCX extensions ocx Editor's note: do we need to get context URI for OCX? Recommended Properties Property Expected Type Defintion ocx:defaultOrder a list of URIs The default order in which to present the resources in the aggregation to the user. Note: The ordering may be changed for many reasons, for example, remixing the content or adaptive delivery. Note: JSON-LD arrays are unordered by default (in contrast with regular JSON). Ordering can be enforced using the @list JSON-LD keyword. Note: In JSON-LD lists of lists are not allowed. Therefor the ordering for each level of a hierarchical aggregation must be specified separately. Example A module comprising a sequence of two topics, the first of which is a sequence of three lessons. { \"@context\": { \"ex\": \"http://example.org/\" , \"sdo\": \"http://schema.org/\" , \"oer\": \"http://oerschema.org/\", \"sdo:hasPart\" : { \"@type\" : \"@id\" } }, \"@graph\": [ { \"@id\": \"ex:Module1#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Module\"], \"sdo:hasPart\": [\"ex:TopicA#A\", \"ex:TopicB#A\" ], \"ocx:defaultOrder\": {\"@list\": [\"ex:TopicA#A\", \"ex:TopicB#A\"]} }, { \"@id\": \"ex:TopicA#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Unit\"], \"sdo:hasPart\": [ \"ex:Lesson1#A\", \"ex:Lesson2#A\", \"ex:Lesson3#A\" ], \"ocx:defaultOrder\": { \"@list\": [\"ex:Lesson1#A\", \"ex:Lesson2#A\", \"ex:Lesson3#A\"] } }, { \"@id\": \"ex:TopicB#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Unit\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson1#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson2#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] }, { \"@id\": \"ex:Lesson3#A\", \"@type\": [\"sdo:CreativeWork\", \"oer:Lesson\"] } ] } An Ordered Aggregation - Option 2 We provide information about logical and pedagogically appropriate sequences for displaying or presenting the components of complex curriculum materials using schema.org ItemLists. Ordering several levels of a hierarchy requires that we nest ItemLists, i.e. we have lists of lists. We have to be careful because reuse and repurposing of resources means that the same resources may appear in different orders when used by different people, however previous work [ OAI-ORE ] shows a solution to this. In order avoid this issue we create resources that are \"proxies\" for the components and sequence these. These proxies can be thought of as entries in a table of contents structure and are the ListItems in the schema.org ItemList.

Editor's Note: do folk prefer their JSON-LD examples as separate linked objects, as above, or as nested objects? Notes: The identifiers should be different to the URLs of specific instances of these resources. They identify relationships that are true for any instance of these resources, and as such they identify an abstract resource of which specific instances are manifestations. Appending #A to the URL of the official or authoritative web page for the resource is a useful pattern for generating a different URI but still using a URI that will provide human users with a meaningful link. Further information about the resources could be provided here, such as the URL to locate the content ( sdo:url ) and the name ( sdo:name ) of the resource, however this would duplicate information in the sitemap used to locate the resources, and embedded markup used to describe the resources.","title":"Example"},{"location":"manifest/structure/#an-ordered-aggregation","text":"Editor's Note OPEN ISSUE : there are two options for ordering the component resources in an aggregation.

Option 2 is inspired by OAI-ORE and leverages schema.org ItemLists.
